.SH NAME
.PP
tttt - The TEA language interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tttt\f[R] [-h] [-d] [-i INPUT | -fi INPUT_FILE] [-c CODE | -fc
CODE_FILE] [-v]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]tttt\f[R] accepts any valid TEA program or script, and runs it,
leveraging standard input and output based on method of invocation.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
TTTT is the official interpreter for the TEA language and it offers the
following command line interface:
.RS
.PP
echo INPUT | tttt
.RE
.PP
For which INPUT could be any valid TEA program already containing its
input
.PP
Or with
.RS
.PP
echo INPUT | tttt -c TEAS
.RE
.PP
Where INPUT is treated as input data and the TEA program is read from
the string TEAS
.PP
Or with
.RS
.PP
echo INPUT | tttt -fc fTEAS
.RE
.PP
Where INPUT is treated as input data and the TEA program is read from
the file path fTEAS
.PP
Or with
.RS
.PP
tttt -i INPUT -c TEAS
.RE
.PP
Where INPUT is treated as input data and the TEA program is read from
the string TEAS
.PP
Or with
.RS
.PP
tttt -i INPUT -fc fTEAS
.RE
.PP
Where INPUT is treated as input data and the TEA program is read from
the file path fTEAS
.PP
Or with
.RS
.PP
tttt -fi fINPUT -fc fTEAS
.RE
.PP
Where fINPUT is treated as data input file path and the TEA program is
read from the file path fTEAS
.PP
In all situations, this TEA interpreter executes the available TEA
program on the available input data, and outputs the final result via
standard output, doing nothing else but quit.
.PP
As a final aspect of using TTTT, note that we can expect that some users
shall wish to invoke/use TTTT in the context of other tools, or rather,
in sticking with the UNIX philosophy of building generic, re-usable
tools, we can expect that TTTT could process input from other tools or
produce output for other tools/processes.
In this regard, we should also note that TTTT can be utilized as such:
.RS
.PP
echo INPUT | tttt
.RE
.PP
In which case INPUT (or whatever it is that is piped to TTTT) shall get
treated as:
.IP "1." 3
DATA in case no other explicit data was specified to TTTT (like via the
-i or -fi arguments)
.IP "2." 3
CODE in case no explicit code was specified to TTTT (such as with -c or
-fc arguments)
.PP
And since TEA CODE can also carry its own data (as with the i:, w: and
creative use of v:, x:, z: and other input containers or importing
commands), this input could be either or both the DATA and CODE - note
that with the e: command, data can become TEA code! When in doubt about
what is going on in any of the above cases, or with any TTTT invocation,
just pass the \f[C]-d\f[R] DEBUG flag to the TEA interpreter, and it
shall display detailed, helpful information about what TTTT considers to
be the TEA CODE, DATA, and the internal state of the run-time before
during and after execution of each instruction in the TEA program.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
\f[B]tttt -c \[lq]i:Hello World\[rq]\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]tttt -c \[lq]i:{What is your name please? }|i:|x:{Hello }\[rq]\f[R]
Are two minimal Hello World programs in TEA, the second, also
demonstrating how TEA program correctly prompt for user-input at
runtime.
.TP
\f[B]echo -n STAR | tttt -c \[lq]a!\[rq]:\f[R]
Takes the input word \[lq]STAR\[rq] and returns its anagrams by
character such as \[lq]RATS\[rq], \[lq]ARTS\[rq], etc
.TP
\f[B]echo -n STAR | tttt -c r:$:T\f[R]
Takes the input and replaces all line endings with the letter
\[lq]T\[rq], such as returning \[lq]START\[rq] in this example
.PP
More examples of TEA programs are included in the project\[cq]s Git
Repository:
https://github.com/mcnemesis/cli_tttt/tree/master/sample_TEA_programs
.SH TESTS
.PP
This Reference Implementation comes with several useful test cases, test
programs and input data included in the official project\[cq]s
repository.
This, so anyone trying out TEA for the first time, or advanced users in
need of forking the project, testing edge-cases, implementing advanced
TEA integration into their own projects and such, can have somewhere to
start.
Check the official test cases via the tests/ path on the project\[cq]s
official Git Repository.

.SH APPLICATIONS
.PP
Starting with v1.0.7 of the TTTT package, TEA now comes with a special
example application of TEA in real-life in the form of a command-line
personal assistant known as ZHA (Zee Hacker Assistant).
This PA is introduced in a paper linked to on the TEA project\[cq]s home
page:
.PP
https://github.com/mcnemesis/cli_tttt/README.md
.PP
And illustrations of how to use or invoke it after installing the TTTT
package are likewise detailed there.
However, in brief, after installing the tttt package, the \[lq]zha\[rq]
command likewise becomes globally available so that, invoking the ZHA
personal assistant via any of the following invocation methods launches
an interactive session on the CLI via which one can interact with the
interesting multi-turn, offline-capable personal assistant.
.TP
\f[B]zha\f[R]
Invoke the ZHA personal assistant without an explicit target entity name
.TP
\f[B]zha -i NAME\f[R]
Invoke the ZHA personal assistant NAME as the explicit target entity
name - basically, the session shall involve your conversation with some
entity known as NAME
.PP
Note that ZHA is still under active development, and so, any glitches or
bugs encountered need be reported to the current maintainer: Joseph W.
Lutalo <joewillrich@gmail.com>
