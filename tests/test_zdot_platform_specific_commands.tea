#This test demonstrates how to read the environment date
#using a platform(WEB/CLI) specific command
# in this example, we are trying to obtain the system date
# manually via z:

# First, determine which platform we are on...
z.:PLATFORM # should return either "WEB" or "CLI"
v:vPLATFORM

f:WEB:lWEB:lCLI

l:lWEB # on web... we'll use JavaScript
v:vCMDWEBDATE:{(new Date()).toString();}
z*:vCMDWEBDATE | v:vDATE
j:lGOTDATE

l:lCLI
# we are on CLI, try method 2
v:vCMDCLIDATE:{date}
c: | z*:vCMDCLIDATE | k!:^$ | v:vDATE

l:lGOTDATE
y:vDATE
f:^$:lNODATE
v:vMSG:{ : Got DATE as : }
g*:{ }:vPLATFORM:vMSG:vDATE
q!:
