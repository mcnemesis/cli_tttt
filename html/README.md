# TEA for the WEB, TEA on ANYTHING
-----------------------------------

This is the part of the TEA project aiming at realising a TEA intepreter and operating environment that can work reliably over the web such as in a web browser, and by extension, that can then allow people to access and use TEA programs from any operating system, from any device, on or offline.

The plan is to approach this as an implementation of the TEA programming language, hosted by or implemented using [vanilla] Javascript.

### TEA on the WEB --- the PLANNED ARCHITECTURE

The planned architecture for how this is to proceed is as laid out in the System Architecture schematic in the [specification file](specification/WEB%20TEA%20ARCHITECTURE.pdf) path or as in the associated paper:
